# Homebrew cask for the Gryphon Agent menu bar app.
#
# A template: it belongs in a tap repository (gocodedotca/homebrew-gryphon, as
# Casks/gryphon-agent.rb), updated for each release with the version and the
# sha256 of the notarized DMG that `task release-client-mac` makes:
#
#   shasum -a 256 "tmp/Gryphon Agent <version>.dmg"
#
# The DMG is attached to the GitHub release of the same tag by hand, and
# GitHub serves it with dots where the file name had spaces, which is what the
# url below is built from. The whole release sequence is docs/RELEASING.md.
#
# The tap repository does not exist yet, so the sha256 below is still a
# placeholder. Installed with:
#   brew install --cask gocodedotca/gryphon/gryphon-agent
